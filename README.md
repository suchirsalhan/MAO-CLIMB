# MAO-CLIMB: Curriculum Learning for Infant-inspired Model Building Beyond English

## Set-up 
HuggingFace BabyLM Datasets for French, German, Japanese and Chinese have been developed and released here:

```
git clone https://github.com/suchirsalhan/MAO-CLIMB
python3 -m venv venvs/demo; source venvs/demo/bin/activate
bash setup.sh
```

[BabyLM](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cambridge-climb/BabyLM)

Training logs are stored using Weights & Biases (W&B). This requires two parameters `experiment.group` and `experiment.name` to log runs. 

To train an SSLM for  `fr, de, ja, zh ` run the following command: 
```
python train.py experiment.name="japanese-demo-1" experiment.group="suchir-demo" dataset.subconfig="zh_lang_strict_gold" tokenizer.subconfig="zh_cbt"
```


For Dry Runs: 

```
python train.py experiment.name="chinese-demo-1" experiment.group="suchir-demo" dataset.subconfig="zh_lang_strict_gold" experiment.dry_run=True trainer.max_training_steps=100 trainer.num_warmup_steps=10

```

[Cambridge University HPC Cluster]: The models can be trained using the `wilkes3-gpu` on the Cambridge HPC cluster. Sample HPC scripts are provided in `./scripts`. 


To train an SSLM using the HPC, `cd scripts`, and then run the following command in the terminal: 
```
sbatch launch_slurm.wilkes3 experiment.name="japanese-demo-1" experiment.group="suchir-demo" dataset.subconfig="ja_lang_strict_gold"
```

## ðŸ§— CLIMB 
The code is based on the Cambridge University & Collaborator's submission to the [Baby LM Challenge](https://babylm.github.io/) (strict-small track) for **English-based Small-Scale Language Models**.
